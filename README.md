## Enviroment variables
Before deploying the project, reate an ```.env``` file in the root of the proyect with the following variables:

```
SECRET_KEY (the secret key used by django)
DEBUG (set it to True)
```

By default, I'm showing the email recovery message for the password in the console. If you using something like mailtrap to send the emails, add this variables:
```
EMAIL_USER         both provided by the smtp service
EMAIL_PASSWORD
```
And change the ```USING_MAILTRAP``` variable located in ```settings.py``` to ```True```
